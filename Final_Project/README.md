# Time Drags On
MSCH-C220 Game Jam, April 2022

## Theme
Time crunch - we took the theme as there being a constant time pressure on the player, which we implemented as a key characteristic of gameplay.

## Game Play
Time Drags On: A Match-3 dragon-themed game where you make matches of (at least) 3 and prevent the timer from reaching 0. If it does, you lose.
Drag pieces left, right, up or down to make matches of (at least) 3 in a row. Each match adds a second onto the clock, that starts at 10 seconds at the start of the game. 

## Impediments
Struggles or surprises you encountered during the development of the game

## Implementation
